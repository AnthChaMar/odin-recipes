        <h2 class="heading two">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li class="item">2 medium russet potatoes, shredded </li>
            <li class="item">½ medium onion, finely chopped </li>
            <li class="item">¼ cup all-purpose flour </li>
            <li class="item">1 egg </li>
            <li class="item">1 cup oil for frying, or as needed </li>
            <li class="item">salt and pepper to taste </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2 class="heading three">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="olist">
            <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
            <li>Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry. </li>
            <li>Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed. </li>
            <li>Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes. </li>
            <li>Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping. </li>
            <li>Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately. </li>
        </ol>
