                <ol class="olist">
                    <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
                    <li>Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry. </li>
                    <li>Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed. </li>
                    <li>Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes. </li>
                    <li>Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping. </li>
                    <li>Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately. </li>
