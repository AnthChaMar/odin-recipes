        <ol class="olist" >
            <li>Sprinkle roast with 2 tablespoons fajita 
                seasoning. In a large skillet, heat oil 
                over medium heat; brown meat. Transfer 
                meat to a 5- or 6-qt. slow cooker. In a 
                large bowl, combine the next 8 ingredients
                and remaining 1 tablespoon fajita seasoning; 
                pour over meat. Cook, covered, on low until 
                a thermometer inserted in pork reads at least 
                145Â°, about 3 hours.</li>

                Remove roast; cool slightly. Cut pork into 
                bite-sized pieces; return to slow cooker.

                rice and hot sauce.
